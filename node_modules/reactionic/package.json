So if you prefer React over Angular, give React-Ionic a try!\n\n## Is this for me?\n\nReact-Ionic is useful for you if you:\n\n* Want to create an iOS and/or Android app coding in **Javascript**.\n* Like **React**, or don't mind learning it (you won't regret it; ask me for how to get started).\n* Optionally: Use **Meteor** (this is basically a clone of [Meteoric](http://meteoric.github.io/), but without a dependency on Meteor).\n\n## Demo\n\n[Kitchen sink demo](http://reactionic.github.io/#demo) showing off all features ([source](https://github.com/reactionic/reactionic-kitchensink))\n\n## Quick Start\n\nIf you know what you are doing: React-Ionic is available as an NPM package that can be added to your package.json\n\n    npm install reactionic --save\n    \nOr just follow the steps below:\n\n### Step 1: download\n\nThe easiest way to start is to download the [kitchen sink demo](https://github.com/reactionic/reactionic-kitchensink), and run it locally (see the [kitchensink README](https://github.com/reactionic/reactionic-kitchensink/blob/master/README.md) how) to try it out.\n\n### Step 2: code\n\nThere is no step 2. Just go ahead and change things to make it your own. Have a look at the [guide](https://github.com/reactionic/reactionic/blob/master/GUIDE.md) for more detail.\n\n## Status\n\nFirst release is available for use. We're working on support for Ionic v2, no ETA yet.\n\n## Guide\n\nA detailed description of each component can be found in the [guide](https://github.com/reactionic/reactionic/blob/master/GUIDE.md).\n\n## Contribute\n\nI need your help to improve this library.\n\n* If you want to patch a bug: create a [pull request]()\n* If you want to make a more substantial contribution, please **contact me**: mark (a) pors.net\n\nLooking forward to your contribution! If you have any questions about it, just drop me an email.\n\n\n## Credits\n\nInspiration and code was \"borrowed\" from: \n\n* [Nick Wientge](https://github.com/meteoric/meteor-ionic)\n* [Sam Corcos](https://github.com/samcorcos)\n\nContributors:\n\n* [Mark Pors](https://github.com/pors/)\n* [Gabriel Garc√≠a Seco](https://github.com/gabrielseco)\n* [Charlie van de Kerkhof](https://github.com/primeminister)\n* [John Slemmer](https://github.com/johnslemmer)\n\n**Thanks guys!**\n\n## License\n\n[Apache License, Version 2.0](https://github.com/reactionic/reactionic/blob/master/LICENSE)\n",
