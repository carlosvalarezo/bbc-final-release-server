The 29-year-old latched on to it and thumped home his shot via the woodwork.</paragraph><paragraph>It was the minimum the Foxes deserved having dominated possession, and they increased their lead after half-time when captain Morgan lashed in a fierce volley.</paragraph><paragraph>The defending champions should have made it 3-0 but Fabianski guessed where Mahrez would place his spot-kick after Okazaki had been fouled in the area by Jordi Amat. The Japanese forward then saw his follow-up saved by the Polish keeper.</paragraph><crosshead>Swansea leave it too late</crosshead><paragraph>Francesco Guidolin's side had gone AWOL as an attacking force during the first 30 minutes of this game as Leicester harried and pushed them back.</paragraph><paragraph>Bar a couple of tame Gylfi Sigurdsson efforts, it appeared it might be a case of how many Leicester would score after Morgan made it 2-0.</paragraph><paragraph>But then the Swans clicked into gear. Gambian winger Modou Barrow, who was sensational down the right and put in a handful of great deliveries, was justly rewarded for his efforts when Dutch midfielder Fer got on the end of another peach of a cross in the 81st minute.</paragraph><paragraph>Foxes full-back Danny Simpson also had to be on hand to clear another Barrow cross, with striker Fernando Llorente poised in the area.</paragraph><crosshead>Schmeichel worry</crosshead><paragraph>Leicester's number one Kasper Schmeichel had little to do in the game, but his one vital interception resulted in him coming off the pitch.</paragraph><paragraph>The Danish goalkeeper was at his sharpest as he rushed out to beat Fernando Llorente to the ball, but he appeared to hurt himself in doing so.</paragraph><paragraph>Schmeichel signalled to the bench as the penalty drama played out in the Swansea box, and was soon replaced by summer signing Ron Robert Zieler.</paragraph><paragraph>However, it seems he might be back in action quicker than expected.</paragraph><paragraph>\"He has a small hernia [which he aggravated],\" Ranieri said after the game. \"He was due for an operation on Monday, but he should be ready for our next match.\"</paragraph><paragraph>Schmeichel will have a two-week recovery period after his surgery, with Leicester's next game on 10 September, at Liverpool.</paragraph><crosshead>The stats you need to know</crosshead>  <list type=\"unordered\">    <listItem>Ranieri has secured his 100th Premier League win as a manager, becoming the fifth non-British/Irish manager to reach this landmark.</listItem>    <listItem>Vardy has become the third Leicester player to score 30 Premier League goals, after Muzzy Izzet and Emile Heskey (both 33).</listItem>    <listItem>Vardy has now scored six times in his last seven Premier League games for the Foxes.</listItem>    <listItem>Six of Drinkwater's eight Premier League assists have been for Vardy goals.</listItem>    <listItem>Mahrez has missed three of his last four penalties in the Premier League.</listItem>    <listItem>Fer has scored in two of his three Premier League games this season, having failed to score in any of his 11 games in the last campaign for the Swans.</listItem>  </list><include>  <title>Match Stats Body Include</title>  <path platform=\"highweb\" href=\"/inc/specials/sport/hi/sport/pal-wrapper/oppm-body.inc?match=EFBO855196\"/>  </include></body>",
